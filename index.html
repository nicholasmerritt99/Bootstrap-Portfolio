                                                        I spend most of my time running around with my 6 year old daughter.
                                                        Her name is Mirabelle. She is the sweetest little girl you will ever
                                                        meet. We are always running around doing something.
                                                        Mainly we go to her gymnastics practice, but when she doesn't have
                                                        prectice we enjoy going to the movie. We switch off on who
                                                        gets to pick the movie. Also, we like to go to Nebraska Furniture mart
                                                        nd play with all the cool things they have. We switch it

                                                        spend my time.

                                                        to travel the world. I have been to many places. My top two places so
                                                        far are Rome or Istanbul. It's great getting to see
                                                        different cultures and learning about their history. Also, I enjoy music
                                                        and movies. Both very in genre. I like all types of music

                                                        I mainly want to focus more on the backend rather than on
